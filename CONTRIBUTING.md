  Thanks for your interest in contributing to the GDSC-NIE android project, and making it easier for students to learn in an effective and enjoyable way!
</p>

<p>
  There are lots of ways to help out and become a contributor, from editing the readme file to adding new features in our app. Don't worry if you're new to "open source", or if you're still a student -- we'd be happy to help and support if this is your first time contributing to an open source project. The main thing is that you care deeply about helping people around the world to learn things better, and that you're responsible and reliable.

The app is written using Kotlin and Java, and levrages jetpack libraries, databinding, Dagger-hilt, and AndroidX.
