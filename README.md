# Hacktoberfest 2021 - GDSC NIE

## Hello NIE <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnoob16/arnoob16/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

It's that time of the year again. Hacktoberfest 2021 is here. Support Open Source and win a free t-shirt üòÅ

This repo is for those who want to share their apps, or any idea related to app development that they've been working on!
Feel free to fork this repo and then add the app which you've built! That way you get to share knowledge. And most importantly you also get to know what other app developers have been working on. 
Contributing to open source is the best way to exchange ideas :) Have a great hacktoberfest!
